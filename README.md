## About

This is an unofficial index of publications from the Office of the Ombudsman, a statutory authority established by the Government of Hong Kong in 1989.

As a public service, their website freely provided about 500 investigation reports, which have been published since 1994.

In 2022 and 2025, they removed many old files from their website. Fortunately, most of them have been saved to Internet Archiveâ€™s [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).

The files linked here were originally archived in Wayback Machine by [Archive-It (for the Government Records Service of Hong Kong)](https://archive.org/details/ArchiveIt-Collection-10883), [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archivebot), [Alexa Internet](https://archive.org/details/alexa_dv), [Common Crawl](https://archive.org/details/commoncrawl), and others.

This index is provided for informational purposes only and may have inaccuracies, omissions or other errors. Modern software may not be able to open some of the old files linked here, such as documents created in Word 95.
